\title{Compute a season using cyclical observations}
\usage{
compute_season_peak_threshold(x, threshold_cons)

compute_season_double_sig(x, n_runs_min = 20, n_runs_max = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric. A vector of cyclical observations.}

\item{threshold_cons}{a numeric(1) between 0 and 1. The percentage of the
total a season must reach.}

\item{n_runs_min, n_runs_max}{an integer(1). Minimum and maximum number of
successful fitting attempts.}
}
\value{
a data frame with season's metrics.
}
\description{
Cyclical observations refers to vector on which the element before the first
is the last one, and the element after the last vector element is the first
one.

\code{compute_season_peak_threshold} estimate season's parameters using the
season maximum value and a threshold. For example, given a year of monthly
observations, the peak season is the minimum subset of consecutive values
around the maximum value (the peak) that reach the given threshold.

\code{compute_season_double_sig} estimate season's parameters by adjusting a
double sigmoidal function to the observations.
